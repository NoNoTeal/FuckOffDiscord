# FuckOffDiscord
*Deletes the WebSocket to make Discord stop opening the desktop app from a browser invite.*

Open any of these links in your browser:

- https://discord.gg/test
- https://discord.com/invite/test
- https://canary.discord.com/invite/test

If you open these links with your Discord desktop client open, you get fucking **beamed** against your will to your Discord Desktop client.
